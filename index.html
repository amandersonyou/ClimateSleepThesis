      <h1>climate & sleep</h1>
  </div>


  <div class='intro'>
    <p></p>
    <p>The climate crisis threatens one of our most fundamental human needs: <i>sleep.</i>
      Here, we'll investigate how poor air quality & rising temperatures as factors of the climate 
      crisis coincide with sleep health in the United States. </p>

          <h2>Essential Sleep</h2>
          <h3>Sleeping is a basic human need; healthy sleep necessitates sufficient duration, 
            quality, timing, and regularity with the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders 
            (<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-deprivation-and-deficiency">NHLBI</a>).
          The recommended amount of sleep for adults in the US is 7 hours or more. Sleeping an adequate amount
          lowers a person's risk of suffering from numerous chronic health conditions (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html">CDC</a>).
          <br><br> When evaluating the implications of the climate crisis, the vulnerability of sleep quality is a factor that is perhaps not widely considered, 
          however, poor air quality and high ambient temperatures contribute to sleep loss, a recognized public health epidemic. </h3>

        <h3>Climate change affects air quality in a multitude of ways, whether through excessive periods of drought with dust and 
          high temperatures, increasing wildfire frequency and ground-level ozone pollution, or through shifts in the growing season. 
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class='factoid'>
          More than one third of Americans report insufficient sleep.

          <h2>Air Pollutants</h2>
          <h3>Air pollution is the result of the release of harmful or excessive quantities of gaseous substances such as nitrogen dioxide, 
            ozone, and particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339334">NCBI</a>). 
            According to the <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/">2018 National Climate Assessment</a>, more than 100 million 
            people in the USA reside where air pollution exceeds health-based air quality standards. <br><br>The World Health Organization reported 
            in 2018 that <b>9 out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air</b>, and an estimated 7 million people die every year due to exposure 
            to fine particles in polluted air. The climate crisis will continue to worsen these existing 
            air pollution levels.</h3>
            <h3>Observe decade annual reports from 1980 through 2019. Overall maximum values have come down into a more moderate range, however 
              key locations in the US experience strikingly high AQI levels as a result of wildfires, droughts, and industrial activities. </h3>

          <h3>The frequency and severity of respiratory illnesses such as asthma are expected to increase as a result of the climate crisis. 
            These increases are due to changes in weather which contributes to the concentrations of both ozone and particulate matter in 
            the air, both of which adversely affect human health.</h3>

          50 to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders with insomnia being the most commonly reported.

        <h2>Asthma & Sleep</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
        <div class='wideDescript'> 
        <h3>Asthma is believed to be the result of an immune system response to allergens in the environment. <a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/sleep-health">(ODPHP)</a> 
          When you are asleep, you breathe less often, less deeply, and absorb less oxygen. For people who suffer from asthma, their 
          symptoms typically worsen during early morning sleep. <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/sleep-health">(NHLBI)</a> Many studies have shown a strong correlation 
          between air pollution and asthma in children. Particulate matter 2.5 as well as higher levels of nitrogen dioxide are also associated with 
          greater odds of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). </h3>
          <h3>Regionally, rates of insufficient sleep are also highest in the Southeast and lowest in the Midwest.</h3>

        Nearly 25 million Americans, or approximately 8% of the population, have asthma.

  <div class='description'>
      <h2>Extended Allergen Season</h2>
      <h3>Global heating impacts allergens as it prolongs and enhances pollen production. <a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/sleep-health">(ODPHP)</a> The increase of air pollutants including 
        ozone and particulate matter further irritates the respiratory systems of people with asthma. 
        High concentrations of CO2 from warmer temperatures causes allergenic plants, like ragweed, to grow more quickly and produce higher levels of pollen.
        Rising temperatures also contribute to the extended growing season and increase of aeroallergens. <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/">(NCA)</a>

      <h3>The climate crisis is not equally distributed. Those who are vulnerable based on income level, elderly age, or preexisting conditions 
        will experience greater impacts due to deteriorating infrastructure, stressed ecosystems, and economic inequality. <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/">(NCA)</a></h3>

        Body temperature and ambient temperature both considerably impact sleep patterns.

        <h2>Rising Temperatures<br>
        & Sleep Loss</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
    <div class='wideDescript'>
        <h3>Temperature is a main factor that affects sleep quality. The circadian rhythm, which follows a 24 hour clock, controls a normal sleep-wake cycle. 
          Thermoregulation is a main component in falling asleep and remaining sleep. Your bodyâ€™s core cools and the temperature drop produces sleep onset (Obradovich et al). 
          Not all people are able to control their ambient temperature with an air conditioner. Those in the southwest and southeast regions of the United States 
          will experience a dramatic increase in nights where the temperature does not fall below 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the near future as temperatures 
          continue to rise with the climate crisis. <a href="https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showClimateChangeHealth.action">(CDC)</a> <br> <br>
        </h3>
        <h3>Mental health is also a concern in relation to rising temperatures. In addition to stress associated with environmental degredation, displacement, 
            and climate crisis anxiety, some people with mental illness are more vulnerable to heat. Suicide rates rise with 
            high temperatures. Those with dementia and schizophrenia are also at risk during hot weather because of the potential for medication interfering with 
            temperature regulation. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/mental_health_disorders.htm">(CDC)</a> </h3>

  <div class='intro'>
    <p></p>
    <p>There are a number of studies exploring the relationship between the climate crisis and sleep health, however it is a relatively new focus and increased research is needed in this area. 
      Hopefully, with increased awareness of active and impending climate changes and deeper understanding of the repercussions in relation to our essential human health, we will be more proactive 
      in combatting the climate crisis. </p>

  <p>Utilizing data from United States government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Centers for Environmental 
      Information (NCEI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), I explore both recent and historical data. This project aims 
      to increase understanding of current climate circumstances to improve social well-being.</p>

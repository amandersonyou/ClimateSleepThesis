      <h1>climate & sleep</h1>
  </div>


  <div class='intro'>
    <p></p>
    <p>The climate crisis threatens on one of our most fundamental human needs: sleep. As global heating continues to increase 
      and alter life as we know it, humans are required to evaluate how these changes are impacting their daily existence 
      and adapt accordingly. Not only is the amount of sleep obtained important, but the quality of oneâ€™s sleep is also critical. 
      Here, I investigate poor air quality as a factor of the climate crisis and demonstrate how it coincides with sleep health 
      to determine what the effects are as they relate to children and adults in the United States. Utilizing data from United 
      States government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Centers for Environmental 
      Information (NCEI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), I explore both recent and historical data. This project aims 
      to increase understanding of current climate circumstances to improve social well-being.</p>

          <h2>Climate Crisis <br> & Sleep Health</h2>
          <h3>Climate change not only creates new risks, it also builds upon and makes visible, existing vulnerabilities within 
            communities across the country. These risks and vulnerabilities continue to grow and impact human health, safety, 
            quality of life, and economic growth. (NCA 2018). Among these changes are more frequent and intense extreme weather 
            and changes in average climate conditions such as rising temperatures. Air quality suffers as concentrations of 
            pollutants such as ozone are amplified with stagnant, warmer temperatures, and irritants like pollen enjoy longer and 
            more productive seasons (EPA). When evaluating the implications of the climate crisis, the vulnerability of sleep 
            quality is a factor that is perhaps not widely considered, however, <b>these factors contribute to sleep loss, a 
            recognized public health epidemic.</b> <br> <br>Lack of sleep is linked to chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes, heart 
            disease, obesity, and depression. Sleeping is a basic human need; healthy sleep necessitates sufficient duration, 
            quality, timing, and regularity with the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders (NHLBI).</h3>

        <h3>Climate change affects air quality in a multitude of ways, whether through excessive periods of drought with dust and 
          high temperatures, increasing wildfire frequency and ground-level ozone pollution, or through shifts in the growing season. 
          <b>The frequency and severity of respiratory illnesses such as asthma are expected to increase as a result of the climate crisis.</b>
          These increases are due to changes in weather which contributes to the concentrations of both ozone and particulate matter in 
          the air, both of which adversely affect human health.</h3>

          <h2>Air Pollutants</h2>
          <h3>Air pollution is the result of the release of harmful or excessive quantities of gaseous substances such as nitrogen dioxide, 
            ozone, and particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere. According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, <b>more than 100 million 
            people in the USA reside where air pollution exceeds health-based air quality standards.</b> <br><br>The World Health Organization reported 
            in 2018 that <b>9 out of 10 people worldwide breathe polluted air, and an estimated 7 million people die every year due to exposure 
            to fine particles in polluted air</b> that lead to many diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive 
            pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections, including pneumonia. The climate crisis will continue to worsen these existing 
            air pollution levels. </h3>

        <h2>Asthma & <br>Sleep Apnea</h2>
        <h3><b>When you are asleep, you breathe less often, less deeply, and absorb less oxygen.</b> For people who suffer from asthma, 
          these changes can be a problem with symptoms worsening typically during early morning sleep. Asthma is a chronic condition 
          affecting people of all ages that intermittently inflames and restricts the airways in the lungs making the airways swell. <br> <br>
          Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is described as sleep disordered breathing characterized by intermittent upper airway obstruction 
          or pauses in breathing for 10 seconds or longer.  This pause in breathing cuts off the oxygen supply to your body, and also 
          impedes the removal of carbon dioxide. Your brain wakes briefly to re-open the airways and re-start breathing. OSA can result 
          in neurocognitive and cardiovascular consequences, heart disease, insulin resistance, stroke, and hypertension.
          <br> <br> Studies have shown that improving air quality may help both sleep and respiratory health and conceivably lower the pervasiveness 
          and severity of asthma and obstructive sleep apnea.</h3>
